## 📝 Report
- Captured live packets using Wireshark  
- Filtered by protocols: HTTP, DNS, TCP  
- Identified 3+ protocols in traffic  
- Exported capture as .pcapng  

*Key Learnings:*  
Packet capture basics, protocol analysis, TCP vs UDP, troubleshooting with Wireshark.  



## ❓ Interview Questions

*1. What is Wireshark used for?*  
A tool to capture and analyze network packets.  

*2. What is a packet?*  
A small unit of data with header + payload.  

*3. How to filter packets in Wireshark?*  
Using capture filters (before) or display filters (after).  

*4. Difference between TCP and UDP?*  
TCP: reliable, connection-based.  
UDP: fast, no guarantee.  

*5. What is a DNS query packet?*  
A request to resolve a domain into an IP.  

*6. How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?*  
Find delays, errors, misconfigurations, or malicious traffic.  

*7. What is a protocol?*  
Rules for data communication (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP).  

*8. Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?*  
Not by default, only with keys/certs.
